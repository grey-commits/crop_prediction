🌾 CropInsight

AI-powered crop recommendation system based on soil analysis and environmental data

CropInsight is an intelligent crop prediction tool that leverages machine learning to recommend the most suitable crops for a given region. By analyzing soil properties and key environmental factors, it helps farmers and agricultural planners make data-driven decisions for maximizing yield and sustainability.

🚀 Key Features
	•	Smart Crop Recommendation
Predicts the top crops suitable for cultivation based on user-input soil data.
	•	Machine Learning Model
Built with a Random Forest algorithm trained on real-world agricultural datasets.
	•	Interactive Visualizations
Displays crop prediction results with intuitive pie and bar charts.
	•	Frontend-Backend Integration
Easily connects to a React frontend via REST APIs for real-time user interaction.

🧩 System Architecture
	1.	Input Collection
Gathers soil parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, rainfall, etc.
	2.	Data Preprocessing
Cleans and scales input data; handles outliers for better prediction accuracy.
	3.	Model Inference
The Random Forest model processes the inputs and ranks the best crops.
	4.	Visualization & Results
Generates prediction charts and returns results to the user interface.
